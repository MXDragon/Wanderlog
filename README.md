# Project-2_Wanderlog

Merging the great outdoors and social networking in an innovative and user friendly way, Wanderlog functions as a digital guestbook that allows travellers or wanderers to record their journey, share experiences, and interact with others on a similar journey. 

Wanderlog was carefully developed utilizing Handlebars.js, CSS3, Javascript, SQL, Herroku, Quill.js, and Git branching production technology. 

# User_Story

As a user, I want to log my adventures in a efficient way that allows me to look back on my travel experiences from anywhere. As a user, I want to be able to share blog posts, photos, reviews, and adventure advice in a sleek and sophisticated display, as well as viewing the posts of other users, with whom I have shared interests.
